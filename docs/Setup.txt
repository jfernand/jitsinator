- Videobridges located on seperate servers together with one Jibri node each
- Videobridges are connected to the main instance, the config for that can be found at /etc/jitsi/videobridge. Connection details inside jvb.conf
- Videobridges are configured with custom IDs in order to make websocket connection working. Serverid is configured in jvb.conf (located in "/etc/jitsi/videobridge" for each JVB server), the corresponding endpoint is configured in nginx config at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ [I believe this is referring to the main node, not each JVB] for colibri-ws
- Custom configuration were made to prosody, mainly the token authentication module. This can be found in the configured prosody path at /etc/prosody/conf.d/xxx.conf, prosody-plugins path. Probably mod_token_authentication.lua
- JWT token moderation plugin is used for prosody in order to enable the moderator: true flag in the JWT token to assign moderator privileges inside a meeting
- Config files for Jitsi are located in /etc/jitsi/meet to configure authdomain etc. [This is on the main node.]
